# COFFEE-STORE-SALES
Coffee store sales come from beverages like espresso, cappuccino, lattes, cold brews, and seasonal drinks, along with pastries and snacks. Peak sales occur in the mornings, with higher weekday demand from office goers and weekend traffic from families. Loyalty programs, apps, and merchandise add extra revenue.
